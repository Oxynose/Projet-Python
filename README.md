## Code Architecture
The game is organized into several Python files, each with a specific responsibility:

- **`menu.py`**: The main entry point of the game. It handles the display and game loop.
- **`game.py`**: Contains the game logic, such as managing player and enemy turns, and applying skills.
- **`unit.py`**: Defines the `Unit` class, which represents a unit on the field, with its health, attack, defense, and skills.
- **`environement.py`** : Define the different elements present in the environment to display them and generate their positions on the map using different class such as `Block` and `Environnement`.

### Description of Main Classes:
- **`Unit`**: Units have attributes like health, defense, attack, speed, and skills. They can move on the board and attack other units.

## Obstacle
There are 5 elements in the game environment: 
- Wall: A fixed block that cannot be crossed or passed over.
- Tree: A fixed block that cannot be crossed (like a wall).
- Water: Fixed block, if the character moves onto a water square, he dies instantly.
- Cactus: Fixed block, if the character positions himself on a square next to it (top, bottom, left, right), he loses -10 hit points. If the character lands on the cactus, he loses 50 points.
- Grass: Serves as soil, has no functionality.
